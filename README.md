## Overview
Mastodon is a free, open-source social network. A decentralized alternative to commercial platforms, it avoids the risks of a single company monopolizing your communication. Pick a server that you trust â€” whichever you choose, you can interact with everyone else. Anyone can run their own Mastodon instance and participate in the social network seamlessly.

**Shipped version:** 3.1.3

## Important points to read before installing

1. **Mastodon** require a dedicated **root domain**, eg. mastodon.domain.tld
1. The user choosen during the installation is automatically created in Mastodon with admin rights
1. At the end of the installation a mail is sent to the user with the automatically generated password
1. It seems important to close the inscriptions for your Mastodon, so that it remains a private body. We invite you to block remote malicious instances from the administration interface. You can also add text on your home page.
